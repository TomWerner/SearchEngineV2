Broad Tasks:
	Query parsing - Tom
	MP3 indexing - Tom
	RESTful interface - Cale
	Multiple search types - Chris
	Combining queries - Joe
	
Query Parsing plan:
	Classes To Build:
		Tokenizer - takes a string and returns a list of tokens
			- tests: by checking all the different patterns of input and failure conditions
			- uses: Token
			- used by: QueryParser
		Token - holds a string and type pair
			- used by: Tokenizer, QueryParser
		QueryParser - top level class that takes a string and returns a query
			- tests: Give it all the different input cases and check output
			- uses: Tokenizer, Token
			- used by: Unknown at the time
	Unit tests:
		Test basic equality query is correctly parsed, single words
		Test basic equality query is correctly parsed, multiple words using quotes
		Test operator search
			- being able to parse the operator
			- parsing the operator arguments
		Test combining queries
			- parse the query operator (and/or)
			- parse the different queries
		Test correct query objects are created for each test
		Parenthesized query handling
	Integration tests:
		Test String->QueryParser->Queries->Evaluate queries->Search results works as expected
	Libraries used:
		None
	Possible improvements:
		Make the Tokenizer more modular, stop hardcoding the values of the tokens
		Allow loading a settings file for the parsing
	Final product:
		Uses an implementation of the Tokenizer and TokenParser interfaces to parse
		a string into a query. It can handle parenthesized queries and uses a combination
		of DoubleQuery's and Query's to construct a final Queryable. 
		The tests check the different combinations of tokens and parenthesis.
		For the simple parser the characters can be changed, for the complex they're set.
